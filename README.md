# To-design-a-two-input-AND-gate-with-CMOS-with-propagation-delay-2ns-in-VLSI-design-using-microwind.
Here, I've prepared the gate using 180nm technology and created a two-input AND gate utilising CMOS with a propagation delay of two ns in microwind. For the worst-case input pattern, I assumed that every transistor had been sized to provide an output resistance of 20 K in the worst-case scenario.
delay calculations and other all necessary things are given in my report.
